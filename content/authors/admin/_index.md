Hello! I am a second year graduate student in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics as the University of Toronto. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2024 with a B.A. in Physics and Astronomy.
My research interests broadly covers the solar system in the context of all exoplanetary systems. This includes the formation, evolution and present state of the solar system in comparison to the many exoplanetry systems that have been observed. I work with Prof. Yanqin Wu on circumbinary disks and prof. Marta L. Bryan on gas giant demographics.
Outside of research, I enjoy climbing (like many other astronomers) and playing Magic the Gathering.
