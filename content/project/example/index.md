KIC-12557548b is an ultra-short period planet whose transits were found to vary wildly in depth from orbit to orbit. These erratic changes, combined with a transit profile indicative of a dusty tail, lead to a model where the planet orbits while being vapourized by its host star. We put forth a simple model to explain the erratic changes in transit depth through varying cycles of warming from clear skies and cooling from intense dust cover. We show that if you consider that only clear grains condense when it is hot, and darker grains condense when it is cooler, chaotic behaviour can arise in our model. This model is an important first step of understanding the time dependent behaviour of these systems.
