We look at how properties of gas giants, such as occurrance, semi-major axis, mass and eccentricity correlate with different inner planet types. We also look at how these correlations change when stellar properties are considerd. We consider six inner planet types, super Earths, hot and cold sub-Satruns, and hot, warm and cold Jupiters. We find in general that inner planets correlate with a increase in the occurrance of outer gas giants. We find that these correlations are strongest for super solar metaliccities.
